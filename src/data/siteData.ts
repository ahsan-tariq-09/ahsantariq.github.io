  'I’m currently working across coursework, personal projects, and practical web development. That includes Java projects from class and beyond, exploring functional programming with Haskell to broaden how I think about software design, and running small Python experiments for automation and rapid prototyping. I’m also sharpening my problem-solving through coding challenges, learning JavaScript and React for web development work connected to the Knox Makerspace server, and building a website to help freshmen navigate courses, careers, and academic planning at Knox College.',

  goals: [
    'Strengthen mastery of Java, Python, TypeScript/React, and C++, with a focus on writing cleaner, scalable code.',
    'Build deeper fluency in Haskell and apply functional-programming patterns to real project architectures.',
    'Develop and deploy real systems: the Knox Makerspace server, Freshman guidance website, and KG-RAG Physio Chatbot.',
    'Contribute to open-source or faculty-led research projects to sharpen engineering and collaboration skills.',
